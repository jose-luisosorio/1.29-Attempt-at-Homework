                <p>I am a versatile professional with a passion for crafting exceptional user experiences. Armed with a degree in music from UC Berkeley and a certification in UX/UI design from Ohio State University, I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to the table. As a music educator, I not only harmonize with the digital landscape but also nurture the next generation of musicians. My classrooms are a canvas for creativity, where I share the art of music while instilling a user-centered mindset 
                    My skill set spans a wide spectrum, from conducting insightful user research and devising robust user strategies to translating ideas into tangible wireframes and prototypes. I'm no stranger to the intricacies of user testing and thrive in the realm of UI design, ensuring interfaces are both visually appealing and intuitively functional.
                    With a knack for responsive web design and front-end programming, I code with precision to breathe life into digital experiences. Information architecture and interaction design are second nature to me, and I navigate the realm of analytics to refine and optimize user journeys.
                    Proficient in tools like Figma and Illustrator, I bring concepts to life with a keen eye for aesthetics. My foundation in HTML & HTML5, CSS frameworks, and front-end development empowers me to build seamless, user-centric interfaces.
                    Beyond the digital realm, my journey extends into the realms of multimedia, audio mixing, and the intersection of music and technology. A true musician at heart, I seamlessly integrate my musicianship with design, creating harmonious and engaging experiences.
